In order to build a runnable program, ensure that the files "Makefile" and "calc.s" are in the current folder and run the command "make".

To execute, run the command "./calc.exe" followed by a mathematical equation using 0-9, '.', '*', "+", "-", "/", and "{}".
Avoid the use of spaces in an equation and be sure to include all operations explicitly.

Removal of the runnable program can be done using the command "make clean".
