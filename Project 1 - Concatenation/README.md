In order to build a runnable program, ensure that the files "Makefile" and "p1.s" are in the current folder and run the command "make".

Execution of the program is performed by running the command "./project1.exe" and following the in-terminal instructions.

Removal of the runnable program and object file can be done using the command "make clean".
