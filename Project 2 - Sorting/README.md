In order to build a runnable program, ensure that that files "Makefile" and "p2.s" are in the current folder and run the command "make".

Execution of the program will only be complete if the file "unsorted.txt" is present in the current folder. To execute, run the command "./project2.exe". The output sorted file will be titled "sorted.txt".

Removal of the runnable program, object file, and sorted file can be done using the command "make clean".
